Dojo "Fractal Forest"
===================

This Dojo is about creating fun and beautiful **fractal images**.  

The dojo was inspired by the post ["Create Fractals with Recursive Drawing"](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/create-fractals-with-recursive-drawing).

It is a good exercise in **recursion**.

This Dojo is **suitable for beginners**, and should be **doable in about one hour**.

This is a fork of the [Community for F# Dojo](https://github.com/c4fsharp/Dojo-Fractal-Forest)
